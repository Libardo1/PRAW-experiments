Thought I\\'d update you guys on the crazy train that is Earl.\\n\\nSo, about a month ago I saw Earl, my PTSD ridden coworker, sneaking out of the women\\'s bathroom. Later we got a nastygram from office management demanding to know who soiled the women\\'s bathroom-- here was not only a mess in the middle of the floor but the feces was smeared all over the walls, with a \\'Hi Larry\\' (our office manager) written in fecal matter on the mirrors followed by a \\'Fuck Suzanne\\' written on another. Suzanne is the manager that works on the isolated floor and one of the few females on the floor.\\n\\nSo...long story short, I ended up giving my buddy that works in security a heads up that I saw Earl sneaking out of the women\\'s bathroom. Suzanne found a...\\'handprint\\' on her car door handle that day too. Security checked the tapes but of course they didn\\'t catch shit (some of the cameras were out). Earl wasn\\'t questioned right away, and for the most part, people forgot about the incident (except Suzanne).\\n\\nThe other day, Suzanne came to work and found a huge dump right in the middle of her cubicle. Several of her things had been \"touched\" or knocked over. She immediately lost it, and ran straight to security. Fortunately, since the incident, cameras that were on her floor were now running...and lo and behold....Earl was on her floor at 5:30am. Earl\\'s punch in time is usually 8:15. He was questioned and he had no viable reason for why he was there that early in the morning, and on Suzanne\\'s floor. A search of Earl\\'s locker uncovered soiled rags and a filthy t-shirt.\\n\\nEarl has been moved to an offsite pending an HR investigation. We\\'re all guessing he\\'s going to be canned. In the mean time, should he come to the office while I\\'m there, I\\'m running out the emergency exit. (I\\'m convinced he knows).\\n   \\n**tl;dr**: Earl was caught \"red\" handed. He is now the subject of an HR investigation and has been moved to an offsite far away from the general work population.',\n",

Suzanne is the manager that works on the isolated floor and one of the few females on the floor.</p>\\n\\n<p>So...long story short, I ended up giving my buddy that works in security a heads up that I saw Earl sneaking out of the women&#39;s bathroom. Suzanne found a...&#39;handprint&#39; on her car door handle that day too. Security checked the tapes but of course they didn&#39;t catch shit (some of the cameras were out). Earl wasn&#39;t questioned right away, and for the most part, people forgot about the incident (except Suzanne).</p>\\n\\n<p>The other day, Suzanne came to work and found a huge dump right in the middle of her cubicle. Several of her things had been &quot;touched&quot; or knocked over. She immediately lost it, and ran straight to security. Fortunately, since the incident, cameras that were on her floor were now running...and lo and behold....Earl was on her floor at 5:30am. Earl&#39;s punch in time is usually 8:15. He was questioned and he had no viable reason for why he was there that early in the morning, and on Suzanne&#39;s floor. A search of Earl&#39;s locker uncovered soiled rags and a filthy t-shirt.</p>\\n\\n<p>Earl has been moved to an offsite pending an HR investigation. We&#39;re all guessing he&#39;s going to be canned. In the mean time, should he come to the office while I&#39;m there, I&#39;m running out the emergency exit. (I&#39;m convinced he knows).</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: Earl was caught &quot;red&quot; handed. He is now the subject of an HR investigation and has been moved to an offsite far away from the general work population.</p>\\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->',\n",
