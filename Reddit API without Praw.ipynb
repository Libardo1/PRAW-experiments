       "     u'selftext': u'Hi, looking to get some advice on how to handle a sensitive, family situation. I\\'m not familiar with this subreddit, but am with reddit. I found this forum through google search, after reading a somewhat similar account from another user years ago. I wasn\\'t able to comment on that thread, so I am creating my own. This is my first post to reddit. \\n\\nI\\'ll try to be concise, and explain the situation that I\\'m in and what I\\'m hoping to find in terms of advice. \\n\\n________________________________\\n\\nI\\'m 35/m, divorced, and I have a 3 year old son with my ex-wife. We\\'ve been separated since our son was about a year old, and recently officially divorced. We are on good terms, and have a good parenting relationship. My son is my world, and I\\'m the parent who posts maybe a couple too many pictures of his son. \\n\\nTwo days ago, I had a flurry of notification from the app, Instagram, of comments by an unknown person on my pictures. The comments were fairly uh, venomous, and called me a hypocrite and a number of nasty words. The comments were publicly visible and on ~5 of my posts. The comments spoke to the fact that I wasn\\'t a parent to an older child, and thus a fraud and everyone needs to know. \\n\\n___________________________________\\n\\nWhen I was 19, I was involved in a semi-successful band and was an all-around douchebag. No one has heard of the band and it didn\\'t amount to anything, but at the time it was kind of a big deal and I took advantage of the perks. I was a douche to women, and again, an all-around not good person. \\n\\nDuring that year, I apparently impregnated a girl I was \"talking\" to. When she told me she was pregnant, I told her get an abortion. There wasn\\'t anything else said, and no other options were discussed. I said get an abortion immediately when she told me, and told her I would pay for it. \\n\\nShe didn\\'t. I made it very clear we weren\\'t together and I wasn\\'t ready for that sort of commitment. I didn\\'t really speak to her much, after the I\\'m pregnant discussions. She told me at some point, or maybe I heard from a friend, that she was placing the child for adoption. I didn\\'t care. I wasn\\'t familiar with the concept of child support or aware of being a parent, and I just didn\\'t think much of it. It wasn\\'t something that mattered to me, at the time. \\n\\nSeveral years go by, and I honestly don\\'t think about the situation. It may seem difficult to believe, but that wasn\\'t something that mattered to me and I buried it and tried to forget about it. This was in the pre-facebook era too, so there wasn\\'t any real updates beyond word of mouth, and we stopped having mutual friends. \\n\\nI moved away from the area in 2001, and lived the dream for a bit. Then wised up, went back to school and graduated in 2006. Started working a real, adult job and started making good money, got married, recession hits and I went back to school for my MBA, got a great new job, had my son, got divorced, and present day. \\n\\n__________________________________\\n\\nI did do some research into that situation about ~3 years ago, just minor facebook stalking and seeing where everything was. I couldn\\'t find the child\\'s facebook page, but the mother and her seemed happy. It was obvious that the woman from years ago hadn\\'t given her child up for adoption, and was being a mother. They seemed happy enough, and were in the same area. I just let sleeping dogs lie and didn\\'t pursue anything. \\n\\nThere was a bit of that proverbial, bullet whizzing by you, feeling when I realized nothing had gone horribly wrong and I hadn\\'t been fucked by that situation. It could have been so much worse, and for me it\\'s been all right. I\\'ve never had to pay child support, it\\'s never been outed, and it\\'s been my dirty little secret. \\n\\nI think looking back, it isn\\'t even a certainty that the child is mine. It could be, but it also could not be. I was sleeping with multiple girls during the time I was with that child\\'s mother, and who knows what she was doing. But who knows, right? I did do the comparison game in 12\\' when I stalked, and I thought the child did look very similar to me, but there is some bias there. I just don\\'t know. \\n________________________________\\n\\nSo the comments are posted on my instagram account this week. The comments were juvenile and riddled with spelling errors and just immature. The tone was bitter and jealous and petty. There was a picture I took of my son \"driving\" my car, which is a luxury model, and a facetious caption. \\n\\nThe comment that was posted was, \"Niiiice. A toddler gets a Mercedes and your first born dont get anything\" \\n\\nThis same pattern continued through the rest of the comments. Usually something snarky and often hateful towards me or my son. \\n\\nI researched the account making the comments and it appears to be the child from the 01\\'-02\\' situation. Or a very convincing fake. There are hundreds of pictures on her account of high school activities and local things from her and her mother\\'s area. The year and last name match up. The account appears genuine just from the number of likes and followers and activity. \\n\\nI didn\\'t know what to do, and just deleted the comments and blocked that account. I received a facebook message a few hours later just saying, COWARD, from the same account. \\n\\n________________________________\\n\\nThat brings me to now. I don\\'t know what to do. Do I engage this child, or just let sleeping dogs lie as I\\'ve been doing for a while. I think it\\'ll blow over if I just don\\'t do anything, but I also worry about this child causing me tension or drama. \\n\\nI am sensitive to her position, and I understand it must be incredibly difficult to have been raised without a father. I don\\'t want to appear cold-hearted but I\\'m on the West coast and have my own family and I can\\'t do anything for her now. It is one of my great regrets how that situation went, and I want to raise my son to be a better man than I was. But I don\\'t want to get involved in that mess or wade into any drama. \\n\\nWhat would you do, in my situation? \\n\\nWould you block and ignore, and let it be? \\n\\nWould you engage the child, and try to create a dialogue? I feel like she is kind of, in a childish way, trying to start some sort of conversation. She must be aware of my existence, and the comments screamed, PAY ATTENTION TO ME. So I don\\'t know there. \\n\\nDo I try to contact the mother and inform her, and let her handle it? I worry about opening that can of worms, and would rather not. \\n\\nIs there another possible response? If so, what?\\n\\n______________________________\\n\\n**tl;dr** **Years ago, as a teenager, a woman I was involved with became pregnant and had a child. I haven\\'t been involved in the child\\'s life and have moved away, and lived my own life. Was recently contacted via hateful comments on social media, by someone who appears to be that child. What do I do?**\\n',\n",

       "u'original was here. https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3lblhi/i_35f_just_found_out_my_daughters_14f_father_is/\\n\\nI know I got more downvotes than reddit can even keep track of, I was called a troll more times than I can keep track of and generally save for one or two people, everyone pretty much hated me.\\n\\n I don\\'t think thats fair as I raised two daughters basically by myself for 15 years now. Like it or not, my younger daughter\\'s father showing up after 12 years and changing everything I instilled in my babies about our values, what we do with our time, how we eat, etc... is really hard. I am not saying I was right all the time but I am the one who was there when they cried, I was there when they were sick (my younger had a year of horrible fainting spells that no body could diagnose--her father was not around for that). Everyone can hate on me all they want, but I don\\'t think my actions or reactions are that different from how anyone else would be. \\n\\n\\nBasically the update to the situation is he took her to the gun range anyways after I asked him not to. I said I wasn\\'t totally against it but that before he went, I wanted to talk to him in person about how safe it was (I have NO experience with guns other than the gang shootings that happened in my neighborhood growing up), what they would do there, where the guns were coming from. I don\\'t think any of that was unreasonable, even though I truly despise the fact that people are allowed to have guns. Well he took her anyways. \\n\\nI freaked the fuck out and drove to his house which is on a military base so I could not get a pass easily. I had to have him come and get me which was akward as you can imagine because I looked like a hysterical witch with makeup running down my face, my hair in shambles and shaking with rage and the amount of Starbucks WCMs I had to try and center myself. \\n\\nWe sat down and I did a good job of composing myself in front of my baby at his house. But she could tell I was mad and I think I scared her. The end result is she wants to live with him full time for a while. I did not react like I wanted to which was to beat the ever living shit out of him and grab her by the wrist and drag her home. \\n\\nI said basically \"Chela, that is is fine. You should be with your father if you want to. You know I love you and you can come home whenever you need or want to. I will really miss you.\"\\n\\nAnd I got up and left and cried the entire way home, well into the evening and even some this morning. I am devastated. I am setting up a meeting with a counselor at the student health center for later this afternoon but I feel like I need to be sedated I am so anxiety and sadness. \\n\\nI truly hope I am doing the right thing. \\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n**tl;dr**: After the gun range issue by daughter wants to live with her father. I am letting her but its the hardest thing I\\'ve ever had to do. \\n\\nEdit The campus counselor is staying a little late with me today and I\\'m just about to go into her  office. I have a lot less anxiety even just sitting here knowing that someone is going to try and help me in a few minutes\\n\\nEdit: I just came out of the therapist and they are recommending I go to urgent care or an ER to get a prescription for anxiety medications so I\\'m working with my insurance now to see what they will allow me to do.\\n\\nEdit 2: got approval from insurance to go to ER to get treated for acute anxiety. Just waiting for my Momma and Dad to get me so she can take me and he can take my car home.\\n\\nI appreciate all the help people were today but serious FU to the haters. I\\'m going to try and put in y headphone and listen to music on my iPhone instead do reading this thread anymore. If you helped and had kind words I really, really appreciated it.\\n\\nLast edit: apparently this asshole thinks this is funny or appropriate to message this stuff about my 14 year old daughter:\\n\\nhttp://m.imgur.com/oWWTXfy'"
