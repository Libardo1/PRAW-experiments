       "     u'selftext': u'Hi, looking to get some advice on how to handle a sensitive, family situation. I\\'m not familiar with this subreddit, but am with reddit. I found this forum through google search, after reading a somewhat similar account from another user years ago. I wasn\\'t able to comment on that thread, so I am creating my own. This is my first post to reddit. \\n\\nI\\'ll try to be concise, and explain the situation that I\\'m in and what I\\'m hoping to find in terms of advice. \\n\\n________________________________\\n\\nI\\'m 35/m, divorced, and I have a 3 year old son with my ex-wife. We\\'ve been separated since our son was about a year old, and recently officially divorced. We are on good terms, and have a good parenting relationship. My son is my world, and I\\'m the parent who posts maybe a couple too many pictures of his son. \\n\\nTwo days ago, I had a flurry of notification from the app, Instagram, of comments by an unknown person on my pictures. The comments were fairly uh, venomous, and called me a hypocrite and a number of nasty words. The comments were publicly visible and on ~5 of my posts. The comments spoke to the fact that I wasn\\'t a parent to an older child, and thus a fraud and everyone needs to know. \\n\\n___________________________________\\n\\nWhen I was 19, I was involved in a semi-successful band and was an all-around douchebag. No one has heard of the band and it didn\\'t amount to anything, but at the time it was kind of a big deal and I took advantage of the perks. I was a douche to women, and again, an all-around not good person. \\n\\nDuring that year, I apparently impregnated a girl I was \"talking\" to. When she told me she was pregnant, I told her get an abortion. There wasn\\'t anything else said, and no other options were discussed. I said get an abortion immediately when she told me, and told her I would pay for it. \\n\\nShe didn\\'t. I made it very clear we weren\\'t together and I wasn\\'t ready for that sort of commitment. I didn\\'t really speak to her much, after the I\\'m pregnant discussions. She told me at some point, or maybe I heard from a friend, that she was placing the child for adoption. I didn\\'t care. I wasn\\'t familiar with the concept of child support or aware of being a parent, and I just didn\\'t think much of it. It wasn\\'t something that mattered to me, at the time. \\n\\nSeveral years go by, and I honestly don\\'t think about the situation. It may seem difficult to believe, but that wasn\\'t something that mattered to me and I buried it and tried to forget about it. This was in the pre-facebook era too, so there wasn\\'t any real updates beyond word of mouth, and we stopped having mutual friends. \\n\\nI moved away from the area in 2001, and lived the dream for a bit. Then wised up, went back to school and graduated in 2006. Started working a real, adult job and started making good money, got married, recession hits and I went back to school for my MBA, got a great new job, had my son, got divorced, and present day. \\n\\n__________________________________\\n\\nI did do some research into that situation about ~3 years ago, just minor facebook stalking and seeing where everything was. I couldn\\'t find the child\\'s facebook page, but the mother and her seemed happy. It was obvious that the woman from years ago hadn\\'t given her child up for adoption, and was being a mother. They seemed happy enough, and were in the same area. I just let sleeping dogs lie and didn\\'t pursue anything. \\n\\nThere was a bit of that proverbial, bullet whizzing by you, feeling when I realized nothing had gone horribly wrong and I hadn\\'t been fucked by that situation. It could have been so much worse, and for me it\\'s been all right. I\\'ve never had to pay child support, it\\'s never been outed, and it\\'s been my dirty little secret. \\n\\nI think looking back, it isn\\'t even a certainty that the child is mine. It could be, but it also could not be. I was sleeping with multiple girls during the time I was with that child\\'s mother, and who knows what she was doing. But who knows, right? I did do the comparison game in 12\\' when I stalked, and I thought the child did look very similar to me, but there is some bias there. I just don\\'t know. \\n________________________________\\n\\nSo the comments are posted on my instagram account this week. The comments were juvenile and riddled with spelling errors and just immature. The tone was bitter and jealous and petty. There was a picture I took of my son \"driving\" my car, which is a luxury model, and a facetious caption. \\n\\nThe comment that was posted was, \"Niiiice. A toddler gets a Mercedes and your first born dont get anything\" \\n\\nThis same pattern continued through the rest of the comments. Usually something snarky and often hateful towards me or my son. \\n\\nI researched the account making the comments and it appears to be the child from the 01\\'-02\\' situation. Or a very convincing fake. There are hundreds of pictures on her account of high school activities and local things from her and her mother\\'s area. The year and last name match up. The account appears genuine just from the number of likes and followers and activity. \\n\\nI didn\\'t know what to do, and just deleted the comments and blocked that account. I received a facebook message a few hours later just saying, COWARD, from the same account. \\n\\n________________________________\\n\\nThat brings me to now. I don\\'t know what to do. Do I engage this child, or just let sleeping dogs lie as I\\'ve been doing for a while. I think it\\'ll blow over if I just don\\'t do anything, but I also worry about this child causing me tension or drama. \\n\\nI am sensitive to her position, and I understand it must be incredibly difficult to have been raised without a father. I don\\'t want to appear cold-hearted but I\\'m on the West coast and have my own family and I can\\'t do anything for her now. It is one of my great regrets how that situation went, and I want to raise my son to be a better man than I was. But I don\\'t want to get involved in that mess or wade into any drama. \\n\\nWhat would you do, in my situation? \\n\\nWould you block and ignore, and let it be? \\n\\nWould you engage the child, and try to create a dialogue? I feel like she is kind of, in a childish way, trying to start some sort of conversation. She must be aware of my existence, and the comments screamed, PAY ATTENTION TO ME. So I don\\'t know there. \\n\\nDo I try to contact the mother and inform her, and let her handle it? I worry about opening that can of worms, and would rather not. \\n\\nIs there another possible response? If so, what?\\n\\n______________________________\\n\\n**tl;dr** **Years ago, as a teenager, a woman I was involved with became pregnant and had a child. I haven\\'t been involved in the child\\'s life and have moved away, and lived my own life. Was recently contacted via hateful comments on social media, by someone who appears to be that child. What do I do?**\\n',\n",

       "u'My boyfriend and I have been dating for 4 years and living together for 1. We are very compatible in all areas except for one: our diets. I am strictly vegan and he is a meat eater. I believe that eating meat is morally wrong and tried to convert him to no avail. At this point I have accepted that he and I will never agree on this one subject. We have made compromises in our home that work perfectly - he does not cook or eat meat around me and stores his meat in a mini-fridge, and in return he gets to use our extra bedroom as an office. \\n\\nWe plan on getting engaged very soon. Naturally, we\\'ve been having several serious conversations about our future, i.e. where we want to live and how many kids we want to have. Recently I mentioned that I planned on raising our children vegetarian (as vegan as possible) and he FLIPPED out. I have never seen him so angry! He went on and on about how he wants our kids to be \\'normal\\' and wants them to experience hot dogs at baseball games, etc etc like he did when he was a child. He also said that it is impossible for them to get adequate nutrition without eating meat. I told him very calmly that this is an issue I\\'m not willing to compromise on, and he said, \"no children of mine will be vegetarian. End of story.\" After he said that, I ended the conversation because I could tell we were getting nowhere. This is one of the biggest arguments we\\'ve ever had. \\n\\nI don\\'t understand why he\\'s surprised- he knows how strong my feelings are on the subject, so I can\\'t believe he expected me to be okay with feeding meat to my children. This is an issue I\\'m not compromising on. My future kids can decide to stop being vegetarian when they\\'re older if they wish, but I will not introduce meat into their diets. I\\'m very hurt at how my boyfriend reacted- up until now I thought he respected me and my views. I don\\'t want to end this relationship because I love him very very much, and except for this one issue we get along perfectly. I just don\\'t know where to go from here.\\n\\n---   \\n**tl;dr**: Boyfriend got angry at me when I told him I planned on raising our children vegetarian, not sure if we can compromise \\n\\n\\n**EDIT: Well, I\\'m getting quite a bit of hostility. Not sure why people are calling me \\'entitled\\', when he expressed the same sentiment (\"Our kids will be not be vegetarian. End of story\") that I did, just on the opposite side of the issue. Same exact attitude. Same exact \\'entitlement\\' or whatever. Anyway. He\\'s getting home from work soon, so I believe I\\'ll stop reading this thread and speak to him about the issue further. Perhaps I\\'ll post an update.**\\n\\n**Thanks to the helpful commenters.**'"

Husband insisted on taking the RV with him without me, I convinced him to let me come. Now he is ranting about how he doesn\\'t want me on the trip while I sit in the back of the RV hating my life.\\n\\nI promised I would update, but things got very hectic and this is the first chance I have gotten. This whole situation makes me very emotional, so please forgive me if this post is not as coherent as I would like it to be.\\n\\nWhen I posted my first post, we were on the road in the RV and my husband was giving me the cold shoulder while he bitched at me from the driver\\'s seat. You all had some great advice for me about what I should do, and I listened to a few people who suggested that he might be cheating on me.\\n\\nTim had left his iPad in the back of the RV to charge while he drove. I\\'m not proud of this, but I was able to sneak his iPad into the bedroom while he was distracted by the road. He was logged into his email account and I quickly skimmed over his inbox but didn\\'t find anything suspicious. I then had the idea to check his sent folder and found out that he had been chatting up his ex from college. It made me sick to my stomach to read the messages, but luckily they had not yet been physical. Translated from chatspeak, the message he had sent his ex was basically: \"I can\\'t wait to get my hands on you! It\\'s been years since I felt that mouth. I\\'m excited!\" \\n\\nI was disgusted, but I tried to keep calm. We were on the road headed to another state and we planned on stopping at his mother\\'s house. I knew that if his messages were in the sent folder, that meant that he had deleted them. Tim was not planning on being caught and was trying to hide his tracks. He wanted my RV so that he could take his ex around the state and have fun without leaving a credit card trace. I took photos of the emails and sent them to myself in order to preserve the evidence. I then went back to the front of the RV and acted as if everything was fine. I apologized (don\\'t worry, I lied) for how I had acted and suggested that we ask his mom to help us work through this. Tim said that he was sorry and that he accepted my apology. He said he was looking forward to using the RV in the future and that he was glad I had come to see reason. I smiled and nodded but on the inside I was cursing his existence.\\n\\nWe made it to his mom\\'s house and I made up an excuse about having to change because my clothes were wrinkled. Tim went inside without me and I started throwing all of his clothes and belongings into a trashbag. I then went inside the house and Tim was sitting with his mom in the kitchen. He asked me what I was doing with the bag and I told him that I was giving him his clothes so that I could leave. Tim then got angry and asked me what the fuck was I doing and his mom was simply confused. She asked me what was going on and I told her, \"I\\'m not sure myself. I\\'m waiting for Tim to explain why he was planning to cheat on me with his ex.\"\\n\\nTim\\'s mom then started to cry and yell at Tim while he tried to calm her down. I know Reddit does not have a lot of love for religion, but Tim\\'s mother is a fundamentalist. She had loved me from the minute Tim introduced me to her and it would be an understatement to say that she was very upset with her adulterous son. Tim never tried to apologize to me, instead he chased after his mother saying he was sorry to her. This made her cry harder, because she knew that he wasn\\'t even trying to make amends with me, he was just apologizing to her. She hugged me and told me to just go home and she would handle her son. I thanked her and took the RV keys from Tim (this ended up being a minor wrestling match) and left. I drove home crying, but at least I got rid of my asshole ex-husband.\\n\\nTim called me the next day and begged me to come back to him. He said it was all a mistake, that he was sorry. I asked him why he didn\\'t apologize at his mother\\'s house, why he didn\\'t say he was sorry when I was handing him his bag. I told him that he didn\\'t care about cheating on me, that all he cared about was how bad it made him look to his family. He tried to explain himself, but I cut him off and hung up. I blocked him on all social media and haven\\'t heard anything since. \\n\\nI have gotten a lawyer and have already started the divorce process. \\n   \\n**tl;dr**: Husband thought he could get away with cheating on me by using my RV. I found his emails, packed his bags, and left him at his mom\\'s house. His mom took my side and has ripped into him since. I got a lawyer and have filed for divorce.',\n",
